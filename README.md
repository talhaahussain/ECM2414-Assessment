# card-game

Continuous Assessment for ECM2414 - Software Development, set by Prof. Yulei Wu (Year 2, Semester 1). Uses multi-threading in Java to simulate the playing of a simple card game with numerous players and decks. Developed as a pair programming project.

This work received a final mark of 91/100.

Please see `specification.pdf` for specification.

### Compiling the main program

To compile the main program, do:

```
javac CardGame.java
```

### Creating a JAR file

To create a JAR file containing the main program, first recompile the program. Then, do:

```
jar -cfe cards.jar CardGame *
```

### Running the main program

To run the main program, do:

```
java CardGame
```

Alternatively, to run from the JAR file, do:

```
java -jar cards.jar
```

You will be prompted to input the number of players and then be asked to provide the location of a pack file. Please note that only `.txt` files are accepted, with all card denominations on a new line, with no whitespace or strings or any other symbols. If the executable tells you that there is a problem with your pack file, please check again and ensure that none of these illegal characters are appearing anywhere.

When referencing the pack file, you may use an absolute or relative filepath. Please note that in order to simply reference the file by name (e.g., simply using "pack.txt"), you must make sure that the pack file sits in the same directory as the `.class` compiled files or the `.jar` executable. If there are problems with this, please revert to using the absolute path of the desired pack file.

### Testing
The tests are written using JUnit 4. `junit.jar` and `hamcrest-core.jar` are provided in the submission to run the tests.

#### Compiling the tests

To compile the tests, do:
```
javac --class-path ".;junit.jar" TestSuite.java
```

#### Running the tests

To run all the tests, do:

```
java -class-path ".;junit.jar;hamcrest-core.jar" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestSuite
```

`TestSuite` is a class that runs all the tests.

### Footnotes
When viewing the deck files after a game, it is possible that some decks may have more/less cards. This is normal and to be expected - due to the nature of the multithreaded environment, the game may suddenly end while certain decks have less cards than others.

Please note that the number of players is decided by the user and the pack should be provided by the user as well.
